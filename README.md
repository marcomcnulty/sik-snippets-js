# Sik-Snippets

This is a code snippet / note saving application using vanilla JS and a Rails API. I've implemented a simple authentication system using Rails' cookie middleware that doesn't come as standard with the Rails api build.

When you log in, you toggle the diary open, and you can add snippets that are titled and associated to snippet categories.
